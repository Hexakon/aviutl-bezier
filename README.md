# aviutl-bezier

translates CSS bezier functions to the format used by [AviUtl](https://www.videohelp.com/software/AviUtl), a ridiculously lightweight and gratis japanese video editor with history dating as far back as the 90s. more specifically, it is used by the BezierTrackT plugin included in the 1.14 Extra Pack.

use the tool at [bezier.pages.dev](https://bezier.pages.dev).

a very simple first sveltekit app to learn the ropes of several essential skills:

- props usage (`/src/lib/svg/DownArrow.svelte`)
- using `#if` to selectively display certain elements
- using `#each` to display a list of items
- basic tailwind syntax (truly revolutionary, i'm a fan now)
- basic deploying (in this case Cloudflare Pages)

things i should probably focus on next:

- stores
- localstorage
- timers
- sse?
