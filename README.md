# aviutl-bezier

translates CSS bezier functions to the format used by AviUtl, a ridiculously lightweight japanese video editor dating as far back as the 90s.

a very simple first sveltekit app to learn the ropes of several essential skills:

- props usage (`/src/lib/svg/DownArrow.svelte`)
- using `#if` to selectively display certain elements
- using `#each` to display a list of items
- basic tailwind syntax (truly revolutionary, i'm a fan now)
- basic deploying (in this case Cloudflare Pages)

things i should probably focus on next:

- stores
- localstorage
- timers
- sse?
